# Vibe Coding: Julia Fractal Explorer

This project is a creative coding experiment that generates and explores the mesmerizing world of **Julia fractals**. These are infinitely complex and beautiful images that arise from a very simple mathematical rule.

## What is a Julia Fractal?

A Julia fractal is a shape in the complex plane generated by repeating a simple process over and over. It's a classic example of an **escape-time fractal**.

The process answers a simple question for every single pixel on the canvas: *"If I start at this point, will my numbers fly off to infinity, or will they stay trapped within a certain boundary?"*

-   If the point's numbers fly off to infinity, it is **not** in the Julia set. We color this point based on *how fast* it escaped.
-   If the point's numbers stay bounded forever, it **is** in the Julia set. These points are typically colored black.

The incredible detail and complexity of the fractal emerges from the razor-thin, chaotic boundary between the points that escape and those that stay put.

## How It's Generated: The Math

Julia fractals are generated in the world of **complex numbers** (numbers with a "real" and an "imaginary" part, which we can treat as 2D coordinates). The entire process is driven by a single, simple formula:


-   `z`: This is a complex number that represents the coordinate of the pixel we are testing. This is our **starting point**.
-   `c`: This is a *constant* complex number that is the same for every single pixel in the image. You can think of `c` as the "DNA" or the "seed" of the fractal. **Changing `c` creates a completely different Julia fractal.**

### The Algorithm

1.  **Pick a constant `c`**. This value will define the unique shape of your entire fractal. Good starting values are often near the edge of the Mandelbrot set.
2.  **Choose a pixel**. Convert this pixel's `(x, y)` coordinate into a complex number `z`.
3.  **Iterate**. Repeatedly apply the formula `z = z² + c`. With each result, you plug it back in as the new `z`.
4.  **Check for Escape**. After each iteration, check if the magnitude (distance from the origin) of `z` has grown larger than 2. If it has, we know it will escape to infinity. We stop and record how many iterations it took.
5.  **Color the Pixel**. The color of the pixel is based on the result from step 4. If it escaped, the number of iterations can be mapped to a color gradient. If it never escaped after a certain limit (e.g., 200 iterations), we assume it's in the set and color it black.
6.  **Repeat**. Do this for every single pixel on the canvas to reveal the final image.

## Connection to the Mandelbrot Set

The famous **Mandelbrot set** is the "map" or "dictionary" of all possible Julia sets.

-   The Mandelbrot set is generated with a similar formula (`z = z² + c`), but the roles of `z` and `c` are swapped.
-   Every point on the complex plane corresponds to a unique Julia set.
    -   If you pick a `c` value that is **inside** the Mandelbrot set, the resulting Julia set will be a single, connected shape.
    -   If you pick a `c` value from **outside** the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set will be a disconnected "dust" of points.

The most visually stunning Julia sets are generated by choosing a `c` value that is right on the chaotic, infinitely detailed **edge** of the Mandelbrot set.
